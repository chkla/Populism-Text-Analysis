    This study analyzes how populist radical right parties in Germany, Italy, and Sweden use social media to shape their gender discourse, revealing that public recognition and legal protection of gender equality significantly influence their framing. A low level of gender issue contestation leads to femonationalist framing, while higher contestation fosters antigenderist discourse, both rooted in a common nativist ideology. (generated by ü§ñ)
